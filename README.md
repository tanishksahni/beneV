# beneV
A community  project where people with desire of  innovation and selflessness as  common ground  come together  to help the Human society to develop solution to human problems by creating a real world resource for them. The benefactors can also donate funds to their desired non-profit human welfare organisations. Our intentions are the growth of this world all together hand in hand with technology and the living civilisation. 

Project beneV is a community-based project that serves as a bridge between tech thinkers of today and organisations working for human development and human welfare. 
The greater idea will be just to create a frontend website serving the purpose of the community where people can put forward their ideas and our thinkers can develop a real-world tech resource for them. 
People can also contribute to this change bringer by donating their desired sum of money either to the organisation they fancy or the project their impulse is set to. 
We call the change bringers of tomorrow the Benefactors. And this compiles the idea of project beneV.
